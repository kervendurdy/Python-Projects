Explanation:

1. Import `date` from `datetime`: This provides functions for working with dates.
2. `calculate_age` function:
   - Takes `birth_date_str` as input (string in YYYY-MM-DD format).
   - Uses a `try-except` block to handle potential `ValueError` if the format is invalid.
      - If invalid, prints an error message and returns `None`.
   - Converts the birth date string to a `date` object using `date.fromisoformat`.
   - Gets today's date using `date.today`.
   - Calculates age by subtracting the birth year from the current year.
   - Accounts for days and months to ensure accurate age calculation. 
      - If the current month and day haven't passed the birth month and day yet, subtract 1 from the age.
   - Returns the calculated age.
3. Main block (`if __name__ == "__main__":`):
   - Prompts the user to enter their birth date.
   - Calls the `calculate_age` function with the user input.
   - If `age` is not `None` (valid birth date), displays the calculated age to the user.

This program ensures accurate age calculation by considering the birth month and day.
