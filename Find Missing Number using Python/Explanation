Explanation:

1. Function Definition:
   - `def findMissingNumbers(n):` defines a function named `findMissingNumbers` that takes a list `n` as input.

2. Converting to Set:
   - `numbers = set(n)` creates a set named `numbers` from the input list `n`. Sets only store unique values, so this removes duplicates if any were present.

3. Initializing Output List:
   - `output = []` creates an empty list named `output` to store the missing numbers.

4. Iterating Through Expected Range:
   - `for i in range(1, n[-1]):` iterates through a loop from 1 to the last element (`n[-1]`) in the input list, inclusive. This assumes the missing numbers are within this range.

5. Checking for Missing Numbers:
   - Inside the loop, `if i not in numbers:` checks if the current number `i` is not present in the set `numbers` (which means it's missing from the original list).

6. Appending Missing Numbers:
   - If a number is missing, `output.append(i)` adds the missing number `i` to the `output` list.

7. Returning Missing Numbers:
   - After iterating through the loop, `return output` returns the `output` list containing the missing numbers.
