Explanation:

1. The `gcd_looping` function now takes a list of integers (`numbers`) as input.

2. It finds the smallest number (`gcd`) within the `numbers` list using `min`.

3. The `while` loop iterates through potential divisors, starting from the minimum value (`gcd`) and decreasing down to 1.

4. Inside the loop:
   - The `all` function is used to check if the current divisor (`gcd`) divides **all** the numbers in the `numbers` list without a remainder (using modulo operation).
     - If all numbers have no remainder, it signifies a common divisor is found.

5. If the loop completes without finding a common divisor, it returns 1, indicating no common divisor exists for the given numbers.

6. The main block gets the number of integers and individual integer inputs from the user. It then calls the `gcd_looping` function with the list of integers.

7. The printed message differentiates between finding a GCF and no common divisor being found.
